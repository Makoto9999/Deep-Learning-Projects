## Bacterium Detection - Neural Network
  The dataset on the Blackboard contains various measurements (i.e. size, center, etc) from thousands of bacterium under microscope. The last column with non-zero values indicate the bacterium are interesting enough for further study. Otherwise (i.e. last column with zero values), those bacterium are not interesting candidates for further study.
## Flower Detection - CNN
  150 records of 4-dimension dataset, belonging to 3 types of flowers.
#### Build CNN network with 3 convolutional layers and 2 fully connected layers.
#### Save all models' performance as a csv file
#### Save the top model with the highest validation accuracy
#### Restore saved model and Predict the test data
